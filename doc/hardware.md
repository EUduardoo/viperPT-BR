# Hardware for Viper FRC Scouting System

## Server

Because WiFi hotspots are disallowed near the field, it is best to run this application with wired ethernet.
The scouting server runs on any device with a Linux, Apache, and Perl stack. Any device running a web browser can serve as a scouting device. The following energy efficient hardware that can last all day on a single charge and costs about $300.
